- WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES

  Scan/Collects serialized files from Local PC/Network
  PC's and puts it in a text file as a database to
  write down the files you want to copy (locally/network)
  to another Directory/PC/USB Stick.

  By example for movies:

      PC1             PC2             PCn
                                                   
  file1-F1.mp4    file3-F3.mp4    file...
  file2-F2.mp4    file4-F4.mp4    file...
                                              
  +---------+     +---------+     +---------+ 
  |         |     |         |     |         | 
  |   PC1   |     |   PC2   | ... |   PCn   |
  |         |     |         |     |         |
  +---------+     +---------+     +---------+

               |
              PC3
       
          +---------+ 
          |         | 
          |   PC3   | 
          |         | 
          +---------+
     
     dryncsnsx collect this files into PC3 in fallrepos

     file1-F1.mp4 |   
     file2-F2.mp4 |
     file3-F3.mp4 |--> sfallrepos
     file4-F4.mp4 |

  I  want copy  the file2-F2.mp4 and file3-F3.mp4

  Write the serial "F2 and F3" 1 by 1 line to an text file,
  by defect fcid.txt, but you can use any text file you
  create, it doen't matter if it's uppercase or lowercase.

  fcid.txt content

  F1
  F2

  Use the module Movies for copy this listed files from fcid.txt.

              
- FIRST CONFIGURE THE PROGRAM IF NOT WILL FAIL

  If you make a bad configuration?, use the default configuration again
  $ cd ~/repository-cloned
  $ cp -v mdialog_conf.inc mdialog_conf

  Fill the medialog_conf file, inside the file there are examples:

  * Path source, target for shortcut navigation files (optional)
  * Orders, file by default for create reports and order list
  * Path logs
  * Source files for the database (where to find the files)
  * Prices, Argentine currency exchange if you need

- UPDATE DATABASES

  Databases are saved in plain text

  * fallrepos - Video files
  * mallrepos - Audio files in direcories
  * jallrepos - Game in directories
  * aallrepos - Apps in directories
  * lallrepos - Book files
  * callrepos - Comic files
  
  Write the directory path that contain the files
  in the 'mdialog_conf' file or in the main menu,
  option 9) Configuración -> 9) Configuración.
  
  Manually open mdialog_conf and fill for videos (fallrepos),
  example, with slash at the end:
  fallrepos="/the/path/to/video/files/"
  
  Run dryncs > press 9 > Press Enter > choice 1 > press enter
  
  Check the fallrepos file to see if was filled with the item
  video files.

  $ less fallrepos
  
- STEPS FOR COPY DRYNCS AND DRYNCSNSX

  Both are the same but with diferent database configuration
  see his config file "mdialog_conf" file

  DRYNCS
  Copy from 1 source to 3 target

  DRYNCSNSX
  Copy from 1 or 10+ source to 1 target

  For dryncsnsx, example for Movies/Video files.
  
  Assuming you have everything set up, like 
  the shared resources in the other machines or local,
  update your database.
  
  In the dialog, form, explorer file, you can use the keys
  TAB, arroy keys for jump the fields, or write in manual the path
  and files.

  For rename with serialized name, there are scripts and programs
  for automate the renamed files in the Readme.
  https://github.com/ekardian/dryncsnsx
  
  1. Write the serialized files you want to copy to a
     plain text file (.txt) or in ./fcid.txt (default) and save it.
     One per line without extension:
  
     F100
     F48
     F7523452
  
     There are formated plaint text files for examples for fill
     the sames are defined in the orders in mdialog_conf.
  
     fcid.txt for Movies, mcid.txt for Music, acid.txt for Apps
     lcid.txt for books, ccid.txt for comics, jcid.txt for games
  
  1. Choice only one module Pressing the number key 1 or navigate
     with the arrow key and press enter, ex. Películas (Movies)
  2. Add name or description for the record, press enter
  3. Se3ect the path where the files will be copied, used the TAB key
     arrow keys, or write in manual te path and press enter
  4. Select the plain text where are the listed files for copy
     ex. fcid.txt, you can press space bar for select files too
  5. Done. Option "0" to watch the logs.

     Watch the logs manually, they are saved in the files:

     copiados.log -> Copied files
     fallidos.log -> fails
     dryncs.log   -> the detailed progress of copying used for the
                     rsync command


- MOUNTING SAMBA RESOURCES IN LINUX

  In the server side,
  
  For example we have a Samba shared resource called
  MYSHARE with this configuration in /etc/samba/smb.conf
  
  [MYSHARE]
    comment = My Path to share
    path = /home/myuser/
    Writeable = yes
    browseable = no
    valid users = your-samba-user
  
  In the local machine.
  
  Connecting via credentials
  
  $ touch ~/.smbcredentials
  $ chmod 600 ~/.smbcredentials
  $ nano ~/.smbcredentials
  
  add this lines with your samba user and password
  
  username=ilovesamba-user-in-the-remote-samba-server
  password=your-samba-password-in-the-remote-samba-server
  
  Save, CTRL+o
  Exit, CTRL+x
  
  Mount the shared resource MYSHARE
  
  $ sudo mount.cifs --options credentials=~/.credentials \
                    //remote-ip/MYSHARE \
                    /mnt/samba-from-other-pc

  If not appear the mount.cifs command, install cifs-utils
 
  For Debian, Ubuntu
  $ sudo apt install cifs-utils
  
  For Fedora
  $ sudo dnf install cifs-utils
  
  For Docker
  $ sudo docker run cmd.cat/mount.cifs mount.cifs

  In case still  the command "mount.cifs" not present, try:

  $ sudo mount -t cifs ...
  
  See /proc/filesystems and /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernels/fs
  for a complete list of the filesystems, The most common are
  ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, brtfs, vfat, sysfs, proc, nfs and cifs.
  See 'man mount'.

- MOUNTING SAMBA RESOURCES IN WINDOWS

  with 2 steps you can mount a samba shared resource for dryncs
  
  1. Mount via windows explorer adding a new network location.
     Login with the samba user and password

     Note.
     Dont forget the write permitions in the files shared
     in the remote pc, need it for send the files.
  
  2. On cygwin terminal.

     $ mount -f //remote-ip/shared-resource /mnt/my-mount-point
  
- EXPLAINING COMMAND OPTIONS USED WITH RSYNC

  $ rsync -ah --info=progress2 \
              --log-file="file.log" \
                "source-dir" "Path-destiny"

  leyend:

  -a Preserve almost everything perm file with copy recursion
  -h Output numbers in a  more human-readable format
  --log-file Write log file
  -R Read the 'man rsync'

For more details about the recursion copy check the 'man rsync'.
